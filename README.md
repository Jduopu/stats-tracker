## 🧠 Overview

A full-stack web application built with Flask (Python), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input football player stats—such as name, position, touchdowns, yards, and tackles—and dynamically displays them in a sortable table. The data is stored in an SQLite database, enabling real-time updates and retrieval.



---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create a full-stack project that integrates front-end and back-end development.
- Provide a real-time form and table to manage player performance.
- Practice database interaction, API routing, and front-end display using native web tools.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

- `app.py`: Flask server, routing, and SQLite database logic.
- `templates/index.html`: The main UI page.
- `static/main.js`: JavaScript logic for form submission and table rendering.
- `static/style.css`: Styles for layout and responsiveness.
- `database.db`: SQLite database storing player information.

---

## ✅ Features

- Add new football players and their stats.
- View all players in a dynamic, sortable table.
- Real-time update of the table after form submission.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy locally or online.

## 🐛 Known Issues ##
- Table sorting is static (no dynamic sort yet).
- No input validation or edit/delete functionality.
- Stats are not yet grouped or filterable by team.

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements ##
- Add ability to edit and delete players
- Implement filtering and sorting by position or stat.
- Add login and user-based stat tracking.
- Deploy live using Render or Replit.
- Add charts to visualize performance over time.
